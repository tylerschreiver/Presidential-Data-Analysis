# Presidential Election Results State by State

This code determines when states voted for the winner or loser of the presidential election
I wanted to find out which state had the record for the longest streak of not voting for the winner

Assuming this code all works correctly, the answer is 5 straight elections for 6 states:
- Connecticut (1800-1816)
- Delaware (1800-1816)
- Maine (1932-1948)
- Vermont (1932-1948)
- Alabama (1952-1968)
- Mississippi (1952-1968)

CSVs were made by copy pasting tables from Wikipedia into google sheets:
